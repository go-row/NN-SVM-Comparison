# NN-SVM-Comparison
<p>
<h3>Problem Statement : </h3> 
Using the attached data:
<ol>
 <li>Create a neural network (of an appropriate architecture) to classify the samples.</li></li>
 <li>Use multi-class SVM approach to perform the classification. With SVM you have to compare both one-one and one-rest strategies. You should also do a timing test between these two schemes.</li>
 <li>Do a comparative analysis between the neural network and the better SVM strategy.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The deliverables for this big assignment are: 
<ul>
 <li>Codes</li>
 <li>associated figures with sufficient clarity to convey the message required.</li> 
 <li> A short report of your findings with necessary clarifications (as needed).</li>
<ul>
</p>
<p> 
I suggest you rely on Python with scikit-learn module. One way to learn is read up on the documentation of scikit-learn.

Please note that the last column of the attached data has the target (label) information. This label has no physical significance. You may change it at will provided you do it consistently across the board.

As promised: Here's a terrific quick primer on SVMs and optimization.
